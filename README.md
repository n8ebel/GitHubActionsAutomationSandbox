## Triggering Repository_Dispatch Workflows

Running the following curl command will trigger 2 different workflows:
- `triggered_example.yml`
- `triggerable_tasks.yml`

```
curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.everest-preview+json" \
    -H "Authorization: token <your-token-here>" \
    --request POST \
    --data '{"event_type": "do-something"}' \
    https://api.github.com/repos/n8ebel/GitHubActionsAutomationSandbox/dispatches
```

With this command, the `triggerable_tasks.yml` workflow will run, but several of the steps will not run because the repository_dispath event didn't have the required properties passed with it.

To run the full `triggerable_tasks.yml` workflow, run the following curl command:

```
curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.everest-preview+json" \
    -H "Authorization: token <your-token-here>" \
    --request POST \
    --data '{"event_type": "do-something", "client_payload": { "text": "a title"}}' \
    https://api.github.com/repos/n8ebel/GitHubActionsAutomationSandbox/dispatches
```

## Triggering Workflow_Dispatch Events

Workflows configured to run in response to `workflow_dispatch` events may be triggered in 2 ways:
- using the GitHub Actions api
- from the GitHub Actions UI in your repository

To trigger the `workflow_dispatch_example.yml` workflow, the following curl can be used:

```
curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.everest-preview+json" \
    -H "Authorization: token <your-token-here>" \
    --request POST \
    --data '{
              "ref": "main",
              "inputs":{
                "input1":"some value",
                "input2":"some value 2"
              }
            }' \
    https://api.github.com/repos/n8ebel/GitHubActionsAutomationSandbox/actions/workflows/workflow_dispatch_example.yml/dispatches
```

- The `ref` input corresponds to the `branch`, `tag`, or `commit` you want the workflow to be run on.
- The `inputs` input corresponds with the inputs defined in the workflow file, and with what is present in the UI when triggering the workflow from GitHub
